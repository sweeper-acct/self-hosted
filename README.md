## What you get

- Sweeper frontend running on your own server
- All client data, workpapers, and audit logs stay within your own Supabase project - Sweeper never holds a copy
- AI processing (data normalization, workpaper preparation, client collaboration, audit trails, and professional sign-off) via your Sweeper MCP API key
- You own your data - build downstream integrations (Xero, MYOB, QuickBooks) directly from your Supabase Storage using any tool you choose
- Upgrade by pulling the latest Docker image - no rebuild required

## Architecture

```
Your server
  frontend       nginx + React SPA (sweeper425/sweeper-frontend)

Your Supabase project
  Postgres + RLS   all firm/client/case data
  Auth             JWT authentication
  Storage          bank statement PDFs, workpaper CSVs and JSON

Sweeper backend    enterprise.sweeper-acct.com.au
  AI processing via your MCP API key
  (data normalization, workpaper preparation, client collaboration,
   audit trails, and professional sign-off)

Your downstream integrations (Xero, MYOB, QuickBooks, etc.)
  Your Supabase Storage and database are yours to query directly.
  Read workpaper files and BAS data from your own storage,
  then push to any accounting software using your own credentials.
```

The frontend image is public on Docker Hub - **no Docker Hub login required**.

---

## Your data

All client data, workpapers, and audit logs are written to **your own Supabase project** - Sweeper never holds a copy.

Once a BAS/GST folder is certified, the output files sit in your own Supabase Storage:

```
{firm_id}/{client_id}/{period}/
  final/     - BAS summary JSON (G1, G11, 1A, 1B, 8A) - written after BAS draft
  reviewed/  - GST-coded transaction workpaper CSV - human-certified by Senior
  archived/  - Immutable copy written after Partner certifies
```

You can query these files directly using the Supabase client, the Supabase dashboard, or any PostgreSQL-compatible tool. Build downstream integrations with Xero, MYOB, QuickBooks, or any other platform using your own credentials and your own schedule - no dependency on Sweeper for that step.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Minimum |
|---|---|
| Docker Engine | 24+ |
| Docker Compose | v2 (bundled with Docker Desktop) |
| RAM | 1 GB |
| OS | Linux, macOS, Windows |

---

## Quick start

### 1. Create a Supabase project

Create a free project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) ->choose **ap-southeast-2 (Sydney)** region.

From **Settings ->API**, copy:
- Project URL
- `anon` / public key

### 2. Apply the database schema

In Supabase **SQL Editor**, paste and run `combined_schema.sql` (included in this release).

```
Supabase Dashboard ->SQL Editor ->New query ->paste combined_schema.sql ->Run
```

### 3. Create the Storage buckets

Two buckets are required. In Supabase **Dashboard - Storage - New bucket**, create each:

**Bucket 1 - workpaper files** (auto-created on first registration, but create manually if registering outside the UI):
- **Name:** `firm-{your-firm-uuid}` - replace with your firm's UUID from the `firms` table after registration
- **Public:** off (private)

**Bucket 2 - client query attachments** (must be created manually before clients can attach receipts):
- **Name:** `client-uploads`
- **Public:** off (private)

After creating `client-uploads`, add Storage policies in **Dashboard - Storage - Policies - client-uploads**:

| Policy | Allowed roles |
|---|---|
| INSERT | `anon`, `authenticated` |
| SELECT | `anon`, `authenticated` |
| DELETE | `authenticated` |

Or run this SQL in the SQL Editor:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "client_uploads_insert" ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'client-uploads');
CREATE POLICY "client_uploads_select" ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
  USING (bucket_id = 'client-uploads');
CREATE POLICY "client_uploads_delete" ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
  USING (bucket_id = 'client-uploads' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

### 4. Configure the JWT Auth Hook

This step injects `firm_id`, `team_id`, and `user_role` into every JWT so the backend can authenticate requests without an extra database round-trip.

In your Supabase project ->**Authentication ->Auth Hooks**:

1. Click **Add new hook**
2. Hook type: **Customize Access Token**
3. Function name: `custom_jwt_hook`
4. Click **Save**

> **Optional but recommended.** Without the hook, authentication still works ->the backend falls back to a database lookup on every request. With the hook, claims are in the JWT itself (faster, fewer round-trips).

### 5. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | Your Supabase project URL |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase anon key |
| `SWEEPER_MCP_KEY` | Your Sweeper MCP API key from [enterprise.sweeper-acct.com.au](https://enterprise.sweeper-acct.com.au) |
| `SWEEPER_VERSION` | `1.1.98` (or leave default) |

### 6. Configure Supabase Auth redirect URLs

In your Supabase project ->**Authentication ->URL Configuration**:
- **Site URL**: `http://localhost:3000` (or your domain)
- **Redirect URLs**: `http://localhost:3000/**`

### 7. Start

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f frontend
```

Frontend should show `ready` within a few seconds:

```
NAME        STATUS
frontend    running
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` ->the registration page creates the first Owner account and firm.

---

## Production setup

### Reverse proxy (nginx)

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name sweeper.firm.com.au;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }
}
```

### Cloudflare (recommended)

Point your domain's A record to your server IP. Enable **Full (strict)** SSL mode.

---

## Upgrading

```bash
# 1. Apply the new combined_schema.sql in Supabase SQL Editor (idempotent ->safe to re-run)

# 2. Update SWEEPER_VERSION in .env

# 3. Pull and restart
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d --force-recreate
```

---

## Configuration reference

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | Yes | Supabase project URL |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Yes | Supabase anon key |
| `SWEEPER_MCP_KEY` | Yes | MCP API key from enterprise.sweeper-acct.com.au - enables AI Normalization, workpaper preparation, client collaboration, audit trails, and professional sign-off. |
| `VITE_APP_NAME` | No | Display name (default: `Sweeper`) |
| `VITE_CONTACT_EMAIL` | No | Support email shown in UI |
| `SWEEPER_VERSION` | No | Image version to pull (default: `1.1.98`) |
| `FRONTEND_PORT` | No | Host port (default: `3000`) |

---

## Account setup notes

**Each email address can only be linked to one account.**

Supabase Auth enforces unique emails across all roles. If the firm principal (Owner) also manages their own partner team, they must register their team account with a different email address.

A common pattern is to use email sub-addressing (supported by most providers including Gmail):

| Role | Email example |
|---|---|
| Owner (firm admin) | `principal@firm.com.au` |
| Partner (own team) | `principal+partner@firm.com.au` |
| Junior | `junior@firm.com.au` |

Both `principal@firm.com.au` and `principal+partner@firm.com.au` deliver to the same inbox ->Supabase treats them as separate accounts.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Frontend shows blank page or "missing Supabase URL"**

Check that `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set in `.env`.  
The frontend reads these at container start ->no rebuild needed. After changing `.env`:

```bash
docker compose up -d frontend
```

**Cannot log in / auth errors**

Confirm Supabase Auth **Site URL** and **Redirect URLs** match your frontend URL.
